# Combination_and_Benchmark_of_RL_Models

# Motivation
Atari games have been a long-standing benchmark in the reinforcement learning (RL) community for the past decade. This benchmark was proposed to test general competency
of RL algorithms. In this environment, the frames of the game are inputted into the algorithms as observations. The RL community turned toward Deep Learning and Neural Networks in 2013 leading to multiple breakthroughs in algorithm development. In this project, we wanted to understand what part some of those algorithms played in the development of the current state of the art algorithms. To do so, we benchmarked several advanced and classical algorithms on the same Atari Game, Space Invaders, where a laser cannon tries to defend Earth against invading aliens. To better understand the properties and performances of different algorithms, we extracted base algorithms from Rainbow (an algorithm that combines six different improved DQN algorithms). We would also like to explore new combinations and create our own RL models, so we implemented three combination algorithms that have not been originally explored. We tested Rainbow, these baselines algorithms, and our customized algorithms on Cartpole which is a simple but classic environment for RL.
